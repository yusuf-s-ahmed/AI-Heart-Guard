        - **Impact of Physical Activity**: Individuals who are physically active or athletes often have lower resting heart rates,

        - **Considerations for Health Monitoring**: A slightly elevated resting heart rate isn‚Äôt necessarily a cause for concern,

        - **Manage Stress**: Chronic stress can elevate your heart rate. Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, 
        and adequate sleep can help maintain a healthy heart rate.
    
        - **Stay Hydrated**: Dehydration can lead to an increased heart rate as your heart works harder to pump blood.
